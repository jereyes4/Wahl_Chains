#Three concurrent lines A,B,C (IV) and a triple line L (IV*)
#S_A, S_B, S_C are general lines through the corresponding intersections
#One might want to make them concurrent.

#T is a general line through the intersection of A,B,C. We might also want to make it concurrent with the other double sections.

#As usual, a IV is defined first as a I3 and then collapse the three intersections.

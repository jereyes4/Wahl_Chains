#Three non concurrent lines A,B,C (I_3) and a triple line L (IV*)

#For example,
#A = X
#B = Y
#C = X + Y + Z
#L = Z

#In this case, the node of I1 is (-1,-1,3).

#R_A is the double section through (-1,-1,3) and A inter L. Same for R_B and R_C

#S_A is the double section from B inter C to A inter L. Same for S_B and S_C
